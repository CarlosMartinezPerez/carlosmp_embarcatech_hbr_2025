# Flash_Dump

![Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/images/pico-pinout.svg)  
*A simple tool to dump and display Flash memory contents from a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040-based microcontroller).*

## Overview

**Flash_Dump** is a lightweight C-based project designed for the Raspberry Pi Pico, leveraging the RP2040 microcontroller. This program reads a specified section of the onboard Flash memory and outputs its contents in a hexadecimal format via the serial interface. It’s an excellent starting point for developers interested in low-level memory exploration, debugging, or learning about the RP2040’s Flash memory architecture.

The project uses the Pico SDK and is intended to run directly on the Raspberry Pi Pico, making it a handy utility for embedded systems enthusiasts.

## Features

- Reads a configurable chunk of Flash memory starting at a user-defined offset.
- Outputs the memory contents in a clean, hexadecimal dump format (16 bytes per line).
- Compatible with the Raspberry Pi Pico and the RP2040’s XIP (Execute-In-Place) Flash memory.
- Simple and lightweight, with minimal dependencies beyond the Pico SDK.
- Includes a 3-second delay on startup to allow serial connection setup.

## Requirements

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi Pico (or any RP2040-based board).
- **Software**: 
  - Pico SDK (installed and configured).
  - A C compiler (e.g., `gcc-arm-none-eabi`).
  - A serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, Minicom, or Picocom) to view the output.
- **Optional**: CMake and a compatible IDE (e.g., VS Code) for building the project.

## Installation

1. **Set Up the Pico SDK**  
   Follow the official [Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK guide](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/c_sdk.html) to install and configure the Pico SDK on your system. Ensure the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable is set.

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CarlosMartinezPerez/Flash_Dump.git
   cd Flash_Dump
   ```

3. **Build the Project**  
   Create a build directory and compile the code using CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
   This will generate a `.uf2` file (e.g., `Flash_Dump.uf2`) in the `build` directory.

4. **Flash the Pico**  
   - Hold the `BOOTSEL` button on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
   - Connect it to your computer via USB (it will appear as a mass storage device).
   - Drag and drop the `Flash_Dump.uf2` file onto the Pico’s storage.
   - The Pico will automatically reboot and run the program.

## Usage

1. **Connect to Serial**  
   Open a serial terminal (e.g., Minicom or PuTTY) and connect to the Pico’s serial port (typically at 115200 baud). On Linux, this might be `/dev/ttyACM0`; on Windows, check Device Manager for the COM port.

2. **View the Output**  
   After a 3-second delay (to allow serial connection), the program will print the Flash memory dump. The output looks like this:
   ```
   Dump da Flash:
   00080000: 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
   00080010: 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F
   ...
   ```

3. **Customize the Dump**  
   Modify the following constants in `main.c` to adjust the dump:
   - `FLASH_OFFSET`: The starting offset in Flash memory (added to `XIP_BASE`, which is `0x10000000`).
   - `DUMP_SIZE`: The number of bytes to read and display (default is 4096 bytes).

## Code Explanation

- **`stdio_init_all()`**: Initializes standard I/O for serial communication.
- **`sleep_ms(3000)`**: Waits 3 seconds to ensure the serial terminal is connected.
- **`XIP_BASE + FLASH_OFFSET`**: Points to the Flash memory address to start reading from (`XIP_BASE` is `0x10000000` on the RP2040).
- **Hexadecimal Output**: Loops through the specified size, printing 16 bytes per line with their offset.

The program enters an infinite loop after the dump to keep the Pico running (modify `tight_loop_contents` if additional functionality is desired).  

## RP2040 Memory Structure  

The RP2040 microcontroller features a 2 MB onboard Flash memory, accessible starting at address 0x10000000 (defined as XIP_BASE in the Pico SDK). This Flash is used for Execute-In-Place (XIP) operation, allowing the CPU to run code directly from it. The memory map also includes 264 KB of SRAM split across six banks, but this project focuses solely on the Flash region. The FLASH_OFFSET in the code is added to XIP_BASE to define the starting point for the dump, and care should be taken to ensure the offset and size stay within the 2 MB boundary (0x10000000 to 0x101FFFFF).  

## Notes

- The default `FLASH_OFFSET` is set to `0x080000` (512 KB from the start of Flash). Ensure this offset is valid for your application and does not overwrite critical data.
- The RP2040’s Flash is 2 MB in total, so keep `FLASH_OFFSET + DUMP_SIZE` within `0x200000` (2 MB).
- This project is read-only and does not modify Flash memory.
