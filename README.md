# Embarcatech 2025 Training Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing projects developed during the **Embarcatech 2025** training program, as well as personal development projects. This repository showcases my progress, studies, and hands-on work with embedded systems, focusing on the **BitDogLab** platform. Below, you'll find highlights of key projects, including my personal project **BitDogLab_OTA** and the **Tuner** project, the final task of Phase 1 of the training. The repository also includes tests, development tools, and study materials.

## Projects

### BitDogLab_OTA (Personal Development Project)

This is a personal project, not a course assignment, developed to enhance my skills in embedded systems and wireless updates. BitDogLab_OTA implements an Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware update system for the BitDogLab platform, aiming at the possibility of developing techniques for updating firmware on embedded systems without the need for physical access to the equipment. This is particularly relevant in industrial or agribusiness facilities, where the number of devices and, perhaps, their dispersion throughout the plant, make this update difficult.

**Key Features:**

- **OTA Updates:** Wirelessly upload new firmware to the BitDogLab board using a web interface or local network.
- **Error Handling:** Robust checks to ensure firmware integrity and rollback capabilities in case of failures.
- **Customizable:** Modular design to adapt the OTA system to different projects and needs.

This project reflects my initiative to explore advanced embedded system functionalities beyond the course scope, focusing on practical real-world applications.

### Tuner (Phase 1 Final Task)

The **Tuner** project is the culminating assignment of Phase 1 of the Embarcatech 2025 training. It is an electronic tuner built on the **BitDogLab** platform, designed to tune a guitar using the **Yin algorithm** for pitch detection. This project demonstrates my understanding of signal processing and embedded programming.

**Key Features:**

- **Pitch Detection:** Utilizes the Yin algorithm to accurately detect the pitch of guitar strings.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Provides immediate visual feedback to assist in tuning.
- **BitDogLab Integration:** Fully implemented on the BitDogLab hardware, leveraging its capabilities for audio input and processing.
- **User-Friendly:** Simple interface for musicians to tune their instruments efficiently.
- **Ear training:** Customizable for vocal training.

## Repository Structure

- **`BitDogLab_OTA/`**: Source code, documentation, and resources for the OTA update project.
- **`Tuner/`**: Source code and materials for the guitar tuner project.
- **`other tools/`**: Unit tests and integration tests for the projects. Development tools and scripts used during the training and personal projects. Notes, references, and study materials from the Embarcatech 2025 training (work in process).

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware:** BitDogLab development board.
- **Software:** Raspberry Pi Pico extension for VS Code.
- **Knowledge:** Basic understanding of embedded systems, C/C++ programming and electronics.
